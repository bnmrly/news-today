# News Today

News Today is a social news aggregation and rating website similar to Reddit, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

It has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user ratings and can be voted up or down. Users can also add comments to an article and these comments can also be voted up or down. It is set up so a sample user ('tickle122') can both post and delete their own comments.

It can be found here: [https://news-today-ben-marley.herokuapp.com/](https://news-today-ben-marley.herokuapp.com/)

## API

The API can be found at [https://ben-nc-news.herokuapp.com/API](https://ben-nc-news.herokuapp.com/API)

The repo for the backend can be found here: [https://github.com/bnmrly/BE-FT-northcoders-news](https://github.com/bnmrly/BE-FT-northcoders-news)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a local version running, please see deployment for notes on how to deploy the website live via [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

The app was built using Node 8.9.3 and cannot be guaranteed to work on an earlier version. Please visit [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) for further information.

## Installing

Please clone the repo from: [https://github.com/bnmrly/FE-FT-NC-News](https://github.com/bnmrly/FE-FT-NC-News)

Run npm install in the command line to get the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

To launch the development server, run the start script

```
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at this address:

```
localhost:3000/
```

## Deployment

I have deployed the database to [mlab](https://mlab.com/).

To deploy on a live system, set up a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app and link it to your fork of the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/bnmrly/FE-FT-NC-News).

## Design

I eschewed CSS frameworks as I wanted to combine my CSS and JavaScript skills on this project. I embraced the challenge of writing all the vanilla css myself, taking inspiration from the American skateboard clothing brand [Supreme](https://www.supremenewyork.com/).
